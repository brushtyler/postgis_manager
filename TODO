- create views
- import non-spatial tables, e.g. csv
- add geospatial support to db
- geometry_columns validity check
- use QtSql instead of psycopg ?

- check whether pgsql2shp and shp2pgsql tools exist

- don't expand all if there are many tables

suggestions by Jeremy Palmer:
- don't count rows automatically - only estimated, allow user to display it on request
- don't populate table tab unless the tab is active
- don't render map unless its tab is active
- allow cancel rendering with ESC
