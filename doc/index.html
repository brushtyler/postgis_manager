<h1>PostGIS Manager</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

PostGIS Manager is a plugin for Quantum GIS that aims to be a simple yet powerful tool for management of PostgreSQL databases
with emphasis on support of spatially enabled tables in PostGIS. Target audience for this plugin are users that want to
do some administration tasks on the tables in user-friendly graphical interface without having to type SQL commands.
This plugin is not meant to be a complex tool supporting virtually all PostgreSQL/PostGIS functionality. Instead,
it should help users with typical tasks and speed up the work.
<p>
We hope that PostGIS Manager will help to lower the burden when it comes to usage of geodatabases which are for many
considered as an interesting but too complex concept to use for real work.
<p>
The user should have some basic knowledge about relational databases and their usage. For the simplest use for only
viewing database structure and contents of tables, it's necessary to understand what the databases and tables.
Before doing any modifications, it's highly recommended to understand the views, schemas, indexes, constraints, SQL syntax,
triggers and rules. Otherwise one can do some serious harm to the data stored in the database.

Main window consists basically of two parts:
<ul>
<li><b>database view</b> - this is a widget that lists all tables and views in the database
<li><b>central view</b> - displays metadata, tabular preview or map preview
</ul>

<h2>Short intro to PostGIS</h2>

If you're familiar with PostGIS, feel free to skip this section.
<p>
PostGIS is an extension for PostgreSQL database that adds support for spatial data. Much of the objects we
recognize in the world have some location: a restaurant can be defined by a point, a road can be described
as a line with several segments and border of a forest can be represented as a polygon. This means that
we can extend our tables (containing restaurants, roads, forests or anything else) with another column
which will specify object's location. PostGIS implements adds a new <tt>geometry</tt> type that stores
the spatial information. Once such table contains such column, be call it spatial table or geotable.
<p>
There are many reasons why one would want to add spatial information to objects. It's possible to select
data by specifying a location (all restaurants along some road). TODO
<p>
When working with a large set of data (think millions of rows), it's necessary to access the data effectively.
Relational databases use indexes on columns to achieve better performance of queries. Traditional indexes
however can't be used for the spatial data because they're two (or even more) dimensional. PostGIS comes
with a spatial index (R-tree, as opposed to B-tree used for traditional indexes).
<p>
TODO:
1 table = 1 layer

<h2>Database view</h2>

This widget displays database content in a hierarchy. Top-level items are always schemas (i.e. namespaces),
their children are both tables and views. 
<p>
You can find following icons that differentiate the items in the view:
<p>
<img src="../icons/namespace.png" alt="schema"> Schema<br>
<img src="../icons/table.png" alt="table"> Table<br>
<img src="../icons/view.png" alt="view"> View<br>
<p>
If the database has PostGIS support, the plugin will detect which
geometry type is used for the table (points, lines or polygons) and set appropriate icon (instead of the original table/view icon):
<p>
<img src="../icons/layer_point.png" alt="point" width="16" height="16"> Point layer<br>
<img src="../icons/layer_line.png" alt="line" width="16" height="16"> Line layer<br>
<img src="../icons/layer_polygon.png" alt="polygon"  width="16" height="16"> Polygon layer<br>
<img src="../icons/layer_unknown.png" alt="unknown"> Unknown layer type<br>
<p>
Unknown layer type means that the geometry column is either not listed in <tt>geometry_columns</tt> or some special type is used.
<p>
Tables that contain more geometry columns are listed multiple times, each time for one geometry column. This is however not
very common.
<p>
Schemas can be expanded and collapsed, by default all schemas are expanded if the database contains less than 100 tables or views.
<p>
Note: by default, there is a <tt>public</tt> schema in every database and is used implicitly. This means that
tables in public schema can be accessed just by their name and not necessarily with <tt>schema.table</tt> syntax.

<h2>Central view</h2>

The central part consists of three tabs for inspection of the table metadata and their contents:
<ul>
<li><b>Metadata tab</b> displays basic information about the table: row count, privileges, owner, detailed list of fields (columns),
constraints (primary and foreign keys, unique columns, checks), list of indexes, triggers and rules. For spatial tables
it adds a section about geometry type, dimension, spatial reference and extent. TODO
<li><b>Table tab</b> shows contents of the table in typical tabular form. Geometry columns are excluded from the view. The table is read-only.
<li><b>Preview tab</b> is available only for spatial tables and displays a simple map from the table contents.
</ul>

<h2>Database connections</h2>

TODO

<h2>Database info</h2>

When the user selects menu Database -&gt; Show info, the metadata tab is filled with information about the database connection:
host computer name, current user (role), user's privileges and server version. If the PostGIS support is installed for
the database, it will also show information about version of PostGIS and its support libraries.
